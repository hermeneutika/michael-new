<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>What is
worship? Some go to the English root of the word. But as worthy as
that may be we are not dealing with English documents here. The root
languages of the Biblical texts are either Greek,Hebrew or even
Aramaic. I would suggest that if we wish to get closer to the
original meaning that the Author intended we must look at the
original texts in their original languages. Thats my choice of
viewpoint anyway. Others may choose something else,eg Liverpudlian
slang is the only way to understand these things...but that is not my
choice. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>In the
Hebrew,according to Strongs, worship means to bow down. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>So after a
lot of messing about I finally got this file workings, and also have
got access to Vines in Online Bible, as Olive Tree for me
incomprehensible! </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>But it
would seem that both Strongs and Vines agree on the meaning of
worship. Ie it is to bow down. But this is from the Greek. But from
the Hebrew in Strongs, the meaning is very similar, ie to bow down. </FONT>
