<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>The vexed
question arises yet again. Especially in the light of the death of
our Queen. But the question of mortality and death have also to be
dealt with . We all die. Most I think hate death and even fear it. Of
course such things cannot be discussed in polite or any other type of
society! And yet death is the end of all people. Even women die. And
yet the question of healing wont go away for me. Even if the death is
final and ultimate for every person who has or will ever live. So
ultimately a root cause analysis of death and disease seems to me to
be required. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>If one
does not accept the existence of a Creator God. Then I guess death
and disease are just random elements in a meaningless existence. But
even the death of a Queen hurts. Everything in me cries out against
death and disease. Yet these are unpleasant facts of existence. But
if one is a atheist then so what and who cares. Its all meaningless.
Another meaningless life and death in the meaningless universe. This
for me is the logical extreme of the atheist position. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>But if one
accepts the idea of a Creator God, and especially the Christian God,
especially the Christian God. How does one square the claims that He
is a God of love and mercy and compassion, and yet we look around
this world, and see the misery death injustice,starvation etc etc. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=5>These are
not new questions. Surely it is the job of philosophy and  theology
to answer these questions. </FONT>
